# Car_Price_Prediction

## Domain
Automotive Industry

## About
There is an automobile company XYZ from USA which aspires to enter the US used car market by setting up their company locally to give competition to their counterparts.


## Challenges
They want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the market, since those may be very different from the new car market. Essentially, the company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a used car?
- How well those variables describe the price of a car
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of used cars across the market.


### What is Expected?
Being a data analyst, you must come up with a first step document that lists the output of your exploratory analysis, any issues or problems you may see with data that need follow-up, and some basic descriptive analysis that you think highlights important outcomes/findings from the data. Based on your findings, the next level of analysis will be charted out.

Also, you need to build an appropriate predictive model for predicting the price of a used car. You can perform a comparative study of several predictive models with various approaches and give your inferences accordingly.
